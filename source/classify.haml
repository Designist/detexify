        %p Hosting Detexify costs money and if it helps you may consider helping to pay the hosting bill.

    %h2 What is this?
    %p
      Anyone who works with LaTeX knows how time-consuming it can be
      to find a symbol in
      %a{:href => "http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/"} symbols-a4.pdf
      that you just can't memorize. Detexify is an attempt to simplify this search.
    %h2 How do I use it?
    %p
      Just draw the symbol you are looking for into the square area above and look what happens!
    %h2 My symbol isn't found!
    %p
      The symbol may not be trained enough
      or it is not yet in the list of supported symbols.
      In the first case you can do the training yourself.
      %strike In the second case just drop me a line (danishkirel@gmail.com)!
      ( I don't really find the time to actively maintain this version of Detexify but I am working
      on a version that is much easier to maintain and has other benefits. )
    %h2 I like this. How can I help?
    %p
      You could spare some time training Detexify. You could also
      look at the source of the
      %a{:href => "https://github.com/kirel/detexify-hs-backend"} backend
      and
      %a{:href => "http://github.com/kirel/detexify"} frontend
      on Github (but better look at the
      = succeed ")." do
        %a{:href => "#new"} new version
      If you really, really like this
      you can also donate.
    .flattr
      %a.FlattrButton{:href => "http://detexify.kirelabs.org", :style => "display:none;", rev: "flattr;button:compact;"}
    .paypal= partial 'paypal'
    %h2 Why should I donate?
    %p
      Hosting of detexify costs some money. If Detexify helps you, you might want to help cover these costs. The backend where all the computation is done is running on a server that is sponsored by my employer
      %a{:href => "http://www.zweitag.de"} Zweitag GmbH
      but the fontend is hosted separately and still needs to be payed for.
    %h2 This doesn't work at all!?
    %p
      Detexify relies on HTML5 features so you need a fairly recent browser.
      Opera 9.6 / Firefox 3.5 / Safari 4 / Chrome should do the trick.
    %h2 Do you support Unicode?
    %p
      No. The
      %a{:href => "#new"} new version
      will. Meanwhile use
      = succeed "!" do
        %a{:href => "http://shapecatcher.com"} http://shapecatcher.com
    %h2#new What is that new version you are talking about?
    %p
      The new version is a complete rewrite (codename sketch-a-char) and I already talked about it
      = succeed "." do
        %a{:href => "http://detexify.posterous.com/update-on-detexify"} here
      If you are a developer you might want to check out
      %a{:href => "https://github.com/kirel/sketch-a-char"} sketch-a-char
      on Github.
    %h2 Who created Detexify?
    %p
      Philipp KÃ¼hl had the initial idea and
      %a{:href => "http://kirelabs.org"} Daniel Kirsch
      made it happen.
