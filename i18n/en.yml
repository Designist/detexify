    ## What is this?
    
    Anyone who works with LaTeX knows how time-consuming it can be
    to find a symbol in
    [symbols-a4.pdf](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/symbols/comprehensive/)
    that you just can't memorize. Detexify is an attempt to simplify this search.
    
    ## Who does it work?
    
    Just draw the symbol you are looking for into the square area above and look what happens!
    
    ## My Symbol isn't found!
    
    The symbol may not be [trained](/en/train) enough
    or it is not yet in the list of [supported symbols](/en/symbols).
    
    ## I like this. How can I help?
    
    You could spare some time [training](/en/train) Detexify. You could also
    look at the [source](http://github.com/danishkirel/detexify) and if you want to
    contribute you're welcome.
              
    ## Who created Detexify?
    
    Philipp KÃ¼hl had the initial idea and
    [Daniel Kirsch](http://kirelabs.org) made it happen.

  title: Detexify - Latex Symbol Recognition
  header: 'Detexify - <img alt="tex:\LaTeX">-Symbol Trainer'
  subheader: '[Recognize](/en/classify) Symbols...'
  info: |
    ## Why?
    
    Detexify is based on machine learning. Without being taught some patterns the recognition
    algorithm can not recognize new symbols.

  title: Detexify - Latex Symbol Recognition

  info: |
    ## What is this?
    
    This is the list of symbols currently known by detexify. These can be
    [trainiert](/en/trained) and [recognized](/en/classify). If something is missing please
    send me an [email](mailto:danishkirel@gmail.com)!
